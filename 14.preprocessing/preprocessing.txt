source file -
initially a c prog file will be saved as (first.c)

preprocessing -
this file before compilation, when compiled will add the preprocessing data's in the source file.
after the addition, it will create a intermediate/extended source code. (first.i)
in this intermediate source code, all the #include header files will be substituted with its functions and 
the #define variable values will be substituted insted of the variable

compilation -
then compilation takes place, where it checks for syntax errors.
if no error present, then assembly level code will be generated.(first.asm)

assembler -
then assembler converts asm file to object file. (first.obj)

linker -
linker links all the object files with system libraries then links all object files together. now executable file is generated.(first.exe)

loader -
Loader will load the exe file to the main memory(RAM)
runtime error will be shown here.
